# DARS 2019: CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

DARS 2019: 4th Workshop on the Design and Analysis of Robust Systems
https://sites.google.com/view/dars2019/
July 13, 2019
Part of CAV 2019, New York, New York

# Description
DARS 2019 is the 4th in an international workshop series dedicated to the design and analysis of robust systems. Robustness refers to the ability of a system to behave reliably in the presence of perturbation, either in the system's dynamics and parameters, or irregularities in the system's operating environment. This is particularly important in the context of embedded systems that interact with a physical environment through sensors and actuators, and communicate over wired or wireless networks. Such systems are routinely subject to deviations arising from sensor or actuation noise, quantization and sampling of data, uncertainty in the physical environment, and delays or packet drops over unreliable network channels. When deployed in safety critical applications, system robustness in the presence of uncertainty is not just desirable, but crucial.
The goal of DARS is to foster dialogue and exchange of ideas and techniques across several disciplines with an interest in robustness such as formal verification, programming languages, fault-tolerance, control theory and hybrid systems. Domains of interest include, but are not limited to: reactive, timed, hybrid or probabilistic systems and programs, approximate computing, fault tolerance of distributed systems, and robustness of neural networks.
Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

    * Specification languages for specifying qualitative and quantitative robustness
    * Runtime detection of non-robust conditions
    * Definitions of robustness, application-specific or more generic
    * Computationally tractable procedures for measuring robustness
    * Enforcing robustness of system integrations
    * Quantifying robustness for black-box systems
    * Robustness to adversarial/malicious attacks
    * Robustness in cyber-physical systems

# Workshop Format
DARS is intended to be a forum for exchanging the latest scientific trends between researchers and practitioners interested in various notions of system robustness, application-specific or otherwise.  As a consequence, the workshop will NOT have formal proceedings. We encourage submission of abstracts that address any of the aforementioned topics of interest and cover recently published results as well as work in progress.

# Submission Instructions
DARS solicits extended abstracts, which should be submitted via Easychair at:

    https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dars2019

Abstracts should be in PDF form, up to 3 pages in length, with 1-inch margins and at least 10-point font size, and may contain up to three figures. Abstracts should list the full names, affiliations, and contact information of all authors. If you are interested in demonstrating a technology you are working on at the workshop, including software tools, please indicate so in your abstract submission.
Abstracts will be reviewed by the Program Committee, and will be accepted for either an oral presentation or a poster. Accepted abstracts will be posted to the workshop's website.

# Important Dates

    * Submission deadline: May 1, 2019 (DEADLINE EXTENDED)
    * Notification: May 24, 2019
    * Workshop: July 13, 2019 (during CAV)
