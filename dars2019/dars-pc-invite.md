Dear [*NAME*],
 
We would like to invite you to serve on the Program Committee for 4th Workshop
on the Design and Analysis of Robust Systems (DARS 2019).  This will be a one
day workshop co-located with CAV 2019 in New York, New York, July 13-18 (exact
date TBD).
 
Similar to last year, we will solicit extended abstracts of no more than 3 pages
that provide an overview of recently published work of the authors or work in
progress. We expect that the extended abstracts will focus on providing
intuitions (main results and their implications), rather than technical details
(formal definitions).
 
The review load is expected to be modest, about 4 to 5 3-page papers per reviewer.
 
We hope you will accept this invitation and join the effort. We also encourage
you to submit your work to the workshop.
 
Please share the CFP below with your colleagues and collaborators. More
details can be found at the workshop site: https://sites.google.com/view/dars2019
 
Best Regards,
Houssam Abbas and Justin Hsu

                       Call for Papers: DARS 2019

DARS 2019 is the 4th in an international workshop series dedicated to the design
and analysis of robust systems. Robustness refers to the ability of a system to
behave reliably in the presence of perturbation, either in the system's dynamics
and parameters, or irregularities in the system's operating environment. This is
particularly important in the context of embedded systems that interact with a
physical environment through sensors and actuators, and communicate over wired
or wireless networks. Such systems are routinely subject to deviations arising
from sensor or actuation noise, quantization and sampling of data, uncertainty
in the physical environment, and delays or packet drops over unreliable network
channels. When deployed in safety critical applications, system robustness in
the presence of uncertainty is not just desirable, but crucial.

The goal of DARS is to foster dialogue and exchange of ideas and techniques
across several disciplines with an interest in robustness such as formal
verification, programming languages, fault-tolerance, control theory and hybrid
systems. Domains of interest include, but are not limited to: reactive, timed,
hybrid or probabilistic systems and programs, approximate computing, fault
tolerance of distributed systems, and robustness of neural networks.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

* Specification languages for specifying qualitative and quantitative robustness
* Runtime detection of non-robust conditions
* Definitions of robustness, application-specific or more generic
* Computationally tractable procedures for measuring robustness
* Enforcing robustness of system integrations
* Quantifying robustness for black-box systems
* Robustness to adversarial/malicious attacks
* Robustness in cyber-physical systems

# Workshop Format

DARS is intended to be a forum for exchanging the latest scientific trends
between researchers and practitioners interested in various notions of system
robustness, application-specific or otherwise.  As a consequence, the workshop
will not have formal proceedings. We encourage submission of abstracts that
address any of the aforementioned topics of interest and cover recently
published results as well as work in progress.

# Important Dates

* Submission deadline: April 1, 2019
* Notification: April 24, 2019
* Workshop: co-located with CAV 2019, exact date in July 13-18, 2019 TBD
