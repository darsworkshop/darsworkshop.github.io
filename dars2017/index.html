      <p> Robustness refers to the ability of a system to behave reliably in the presence of perturbation in the system parameters or irregularities in the system&#39;s operating environment. This is particularly important in the context of embedded systems and software, which interact with a physical environment through sensors and actuators and communicate over wired or wireless networks. Such systems are routinely subject to deviations arising from sensor or actuation noise, quantization and sampling of data, uncertainty in the physical environment, and delays or packet drops over unreliable network channels. When deployed in safety critical applications, system robustness in the presence of uncertainty is not just desirable, but crucial.</p>

      <p>
      Our aim is to foster dialogue and exchange of ideas and techniques across several disciplines with an interest in robustness such as formal verification, programming languages, fault-tolerance, control theory and hybrid systems. The first DARS workshop will consist of a number of invited speakers who will share their diverse perspectives on the robustness problem. The workshop will be informal, with plenty of time for Q&amp;A and brainstorming sessions. </p>

<h3> Formal property verification in a conformance testing
  framework </h3>
In Model-Based Design (MBD) of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), such as switched mixed-signal circuits or software-controlled physical systems, it is common to develop a sequence of system models of different fidelity and complexity, each appropriate for a particular design or verification task. In such a sequence, one model is often derived from the other by a process of simplification or implementation. E.g. a Simulink model might be implemented on an embedded processor via automatic code generation. Three questions naturally present themselves: How do we quantify closeness between the two systems? How can we measure such closeness? If the original system satisfies some formal property, can we automatically infer what properties are then satisfied by the derived model? This talk addresses all three questions: We quantify the closeness between original and derived model via a distance measure between their outputs. We then propose two computational methods for approximating this closeness measure. Finally, we derive syntactical re-writing rules which, when applied to a Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) specification satisfied by the original model, produce a formula satisfied by the derived model. We demonstrate our framework through several experiments.

 <h3> Robust Stability Verification and Timing Contract
  Synthesis for Linear Impulsive Systems using Reachability Analysis </h3>
This talk deals with stability analysis for a class of linear impulsive systems subject to a timing contract specifying bounds on the time between two consecutive impulses. We consider the problem of stability verification, which consists in proving stability for a particular timing contract, and the problem of timing contract synthesis, which consists in synthesizing a set of timing contracts that guarantee the stability of the linear impulsive system.
Our approach is based on a reformulation using  parameterized difference inclusions. We derive theoretical necessary and sufficient conditions for stability based on the propagation of a set by the system dynamics. For linear impulsive systems, this allow us to design a stability verification algorithm using reachability analysis.
We then propose an approach to timing contract synthesis, which exploits the monotonicity of stability with respect to timing contract parameters to design an algorithm based on adaptive sampling of the parameter space. Several examples are provided, which allow us to compare our algorithm with several existing techniques, and show the effectiveness of our approach.

 <h3> Automata-based approach to measuring robustness </h3>

We regard a system robust if it continues to work correctly despite of
       perturbations. The perturbation model is crucial here; we
       therefore refer to robustness of a system with respect to
       certain specific perturbations. Also, it is unlikely that a
       system is completely immune to perturbations. We therefore
       measure the level of (specific) perturbations tolerated by the
       system, i.e., we consider robustness as a quantitative
       feature. 

In this talk, we present an automata-based approach to robustness,
       where perturbations are modeled by weighted automata. The
       values returned by weighted automata correspond to the level of
       perturbations, which gives raise to quantitative approach to
       robustness. We consider two types of systems, closed and
       reactive systems, with two different frameworks capturing
       robustness: model measuring for closed systems and Lipschitz
       continuity for reactive systems. Both, closed and reactive
       systems are considered in two variants,  discrete and
       continuous. While we briefly describe these frameworks, we
       focus primarily on the design choices leading to these
       frameworks.

 <h3> A Notion of Robustness for Cyber-Physical Systems </h3>
Robustness as a system property describes the degree to which a system is able
to function correctly in the presence of disturbances, i.e., unforeseen or
erroneous inputs. In this talk, we present a notion of robustness termed
input-output dynamical stability for cyber-physical systems (CPS) which merges
existing notions of robustness for continuous systems and discrete systems. 
The notion captures two intuitive aims of robustness: bounded disturbances have
bounded effects and the consequences of a sporadic disturbance disappear over
time. We present a design methodology for robust CPS which is based on an
abstraction and refinement process. We suggest several novel notions of
simulation relations to ensure the soundness of the approach. In addition, we
show how such simulation relations can be constructed compositionally. The
different concepts and results are illustrated throughout with some small
examples.

<h3>Reconciling Fault-Tolerance and Robustness? </h3>
In this talk, I will provide an overview of classic fault-tolerance
  techniques, with a distinct focus on fault-tolerant distributed
  algorithms and self-stabilization. Emphasis will also be put on
  assumption coverage analysis and how it complements correctness
  proofs. I will relate classic fault-tolerance properties, which are
  essentially all-or-nothing, to robustness properties, which are
  viewed as continuity properties. Instances of gracefully degrading
  distributed algorithms will be used to demonstrate that
  fault-tolerance and robustness can be reconciled, albeit such
  solutions must still be considered an exception today.

<h3> Algorithmic Verification of Stability of Hybrid Systems </h3>
Hybrid systems refer to systems exhibiting mixed discrete-continuous behaviors and arise as a natural byproduct of the interaction of a network of embedded processors with physical systems. 
In this talk, we focus on the verification of stability of hybrid
       systems. Stability is a fundamental property in control system
       design and captures the notion that small perturbations to the
       initial state or input of the system result in only small
       variations in the behavior of the system. We present
       foundations and automated methods for approximation based
       analysis of stability including novel predicate abstraction and
       hybridization techniques. In contrast to the well-known methods
       for stability analysis based on Lyapunov functions, which are
    deductive, we present algorithmic techniques.
